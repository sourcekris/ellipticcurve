# Qi Cheng Factorization in Golang

Code and algorithms to factorize large composites of two primes of a certain type in Golang.

* Code ported from Sage to Golang. Original authors Sage work is here: https://github.com/Sjord/qicheng
* Based on the research "A New Class of Unsafe Primes - Qi Cheng" https://eprint.iacr.org/2002/109.pdf 

Original Golang port by @CTFKris (twitter) and found on [github.com/sourcekris/ellipticcurve/](github.com/sourcekris/ellipticcurve/)
